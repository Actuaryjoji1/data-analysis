. (20 points) [R Primer] Answer the following questions on the usedcars.csv dataset, which 
contains actual data about used cars advertised for sale.
a) Create a variable to store the usedcars.csv file.
```{R}
USED_CARS<-read.csv("usedcars.csv")
```
b) Show the structure of used car data.
```{r}
str(USED_CARS)
```
c) Summarize two features, price and mileage, simultaneously.
```{r}
summary(USED_CARS$price)
summary(USED_CARS$mileage)
```
d) Calculate the median price.
```{r}
median(USED_CARS$price)

```
e) Calculate the 10th and 90th percentiles. [Hint: quantile()]
```{r}

quantile(USED_CARS$price,probs = c(0.1,0.9))
```
f) Draw a boxplot of the used car price and mileage, respectively. Interpret each box 
plot.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(USED_CARS,aes(price))+geom_boxplot(col="purple")+ggtitle("Boxplot of the used car price")
# The values of price are skewed to the left
ggplot(USED_CARS,aes(mileage))+geom_boxplot(col="yellow")+ggtitle("Boxplot of the used car mileage")
# The values of mileage are skewed to the right.
```
g) Draw a histogram of used car prices and mileage, respectively. Interpret each box 
plot.
```{r}
ggplot(USED_CARS,aes(price))+geom_histogram(col="purple",bins = 30)+ggtitle("Histogram of the used car price")
# Price values are densely at the center.
ggplot(USED_CARS,aes(mileage))+geom_histogram(col="yellow",bins = 20)+ggtitle("Histogram of the used car mileage")
# Most values of the mileage are on the left.
```
h) What are the variance and standard deviation on price and mileage variables?
```{r}
# Variance and sd of price
var(USED_CARS$price)
sd(USED_CARS$mileage)
# Variance and sd of mileage
var(USED_CARS$mileage)
sd(USED_CARS$mileage)
```
i) Run table() on year, model, and color variable, respectively. Interpret each result.
```{r}
table(USED_CARS$year)
# Most observations were observed in the year 2010, while the least were observed in the years 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2012
table(USED_CARS$model)
# 49 cars of model ses were observed, 23 of model sel and 78 of model se.

table(USED_CARS$color)
# Most used cars were of color black while the least were of color Gold
```
j) Create a new variable (i.e., usedcars$conservative) that indicates conservative 
colors as TRUE or FALSE.
```{r}
USED_CARS$conservative<-c(TRUE,FALSE)

```  
  Divide nine colors into two groups (conservative colors: Black, Gray, Silver, and 
White; nonconservative colors: Blue, Gold, Green, Red, and Yellow) and use %in% 
operator.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
USED_CARS$conservative<-ifelse(USED_CARS$color%in% c("Black" , "Gray" , "Silver" ,
"White"),TRUE,FALSE)
# First six rowws of the data
head(USED_CARS)

```

[Linear Regression]
Perform a linear regression which predicts an O-ring 
failure under a launch temperature from the space shuttle Challenger data (challenger.csv).
Note that "distress_ct" feature in the challenger CSV file means O-ring failure (i.e., O-ring 
distress events). "0" is No O-ring distress event; "1" is one O-ring distress event; "2" is two 
O-ring distress events.
Please complete the steps: 
```{r}
challenger<-read.csv("challenger.csv")
str(challenger)
```
a) Draw a scatterplot to understand the relationship between O-ring failures and 
temperature and analyze their relationship with your own words.
```{r}
ggplot(challenger,aes(distress_ct,temperature))+geom_smooth()+geom_point()+ggtitle("relationship between O-ring failures and 
temperature")
# There is negative linear relationship between the 2 variables since in the plot.

```
b) Calculate the optimal estimate of � and � in the linear form � = � + ��.
[Check (a) in Note; Hint: cov(), var(), and mean()]
```{r}
attach(challenger)
cov<-cov(distress_ct,temperature)
var_temp<-var(temperature)
mean_temp<-mean(temperature)
mean_dis<-mean(distress_ct)
estimate_b<-cov/var_temp
estimate_b


estimate_a<-mean_dis - estimate_b*mean_temp
estimate_a
```
c) Build a linear regression model and show the result summaries of the model (e.g.,
median, etc.)
```{r}
model<-lm(distress_ct~temperature,data = challenger)
summary(model)

```
d) What is the expected O-ring failure given a temperature is 55 or 75 degrees in your 
model?
```{r}
dat1<-data.frame(temperature=55)
predict(model,dat1)
dat2<-data.frame(temperature=75)
predict(model,dat2)

```
e) What is the correlation between two variables (Use Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient; Check (b) in Note)? [Hint: Use cor()]
```{r}
cor.test(distress_ct,temperature)

```





3. (10 points) [Linear Regression] Please solve the question using simple linear regression
The age and vitamine C rate dataset is given (i.e., age_vitaminC_rate.csv), What is an 
expected Vitamin C rate given an age is 16? [Hint: Review an example 1: Predict a fall 
college enrollment on a year's unemployment rate]
```{r}
age_vitamin_data<-read.csv("age_vitaminC_rate.csv")
# Structure of the data
str(age_vitamin_data)
Model1<-lm(VitaminC~Age, data = age_vitamin_data)
summary(Model1)
# Predictions
new_data<-data.frame(Age=16)
predict(Model1,new_data)
```
